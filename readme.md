# Simple ts game engine

This a simple game engine I built for my own needs for a game but ended up being quite helpful and now it's being shipped as a separate library :)

## Roadmap

This engine works under the HTML Canvas, for know only for 2d games. Anyway, we are planning to support 3d with the use of three.js.

-   [x] UI API
-   [ ] Scene management
-   [ ] Control API
-   [ ] Audio feature API
-   [ ] Create examples and documentation
-   [ ] Add tests
-   [ ] TileMap GameObject
-   [ ] RigidBody
-   [ ] Local save API
-   [ ] Networking API
-   [ ] Create a browser UI to interact with the engine?
